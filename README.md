# Data Representing Ground-Truth Explanations

Due to size constraints, only the code  is being attached in the repository and not the dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from the links provided below.

The code for the entire project is split 3 essential parts:

1) Loan Data - ![Link to Loan Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_7hbPb8FQ488faesZVQDpWo9mxJrG5h4?usp=sharing)
 
2) Time Data - ![Link to Time dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_7hbPb8FQ488faesZVQDpWo9mxJrG5h4?usp=sharing)

3) Distance Data - ![Link to Distance dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CUPRlrwuGYfecG1TToUX8AdHq-YjaYIe?usp=sharing)


Couple of pointers:
- **To run the code ensure that file "Loan_Data.csv" has the same path as the Jupyter notebook "Loan_Data-Lime-explanations"**
- **For Distance and Time dataset, due to the sheer size of the dataset, we already have trained models and evaluation instances ready in NN Models folder and Dataset folder respectively. Please ensure the corresponding jupyter notebooks are linked to the said files.**  
- **Run the Visualization.py notebook to replicate the charts**
