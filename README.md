# Data Representing Ground-Truth Explanations

Intructions:

The code for the entire project is split 3 essential parts:

1) Loan Data - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fOQroK1quGI9vvviaUuekH1KsmbSqZQD/view?usp=sharing
GTE with 5 num_samples
GTE with 25 num_samples
GTE with 50 num_samples
NN1 coefficients from LIME-Loan
NN2 coefficients from LIME-Loan
  To run the code ensure that file "Loan_Data.csv" has the same path as the Jupyter notebook "Loan_Data-Lime-explanations"


2) Time Data - ![Equations used for Data Set Time](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XXNNbjGaN-v3kt8S1rax16GhNgCmBEpw/view?usp=sharing)
Time 10000 Evaluation Instances Correct with labels.csv
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FyQe0lKjoR6WC3oVy2nDMtlu4_eOo3NY/view?usp=sharing
GTE with 1000 num_samples
NN1 coefficients from LIME-Time
NN2 coefficients from LIME-Time


3) Distance Data
![Equations used for Data Set Distance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dd8LCjJi7Va2jAxikVaU13FaERojK9dq/view?usp=sharing)
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PbDRMzxtqq1JNcsAZHcgR42IXSxy3Ta3/view?usp=sharing
GTE with 5000 num_samples
NN1 coefficients from LIME-Distance


  Note: For Distance and Time dataset, due to the sheer size of the dataset, we already have trained models and evaluation instances ready in NN Models folder and Dataset folder respectively. Please ensure the corresponding jupyter notebooks are linked to the said files.
